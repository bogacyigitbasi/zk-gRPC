**Summary**
- Implemented Chaum-Pedersen ZK interactive protocol
- Protocol is primarily used for authentication, simply one can make requests without sharing the secret password
- Created a gRPC server using proto: register user, authenticate, get session_id
- Created a client to make the API calls to the respective endpoints
**User Flow**
- Primarily a Rust library to implement Chaum-Pedersen interactive protocol is created. 
- User sends a register request along with the randomly generated values.
- When a user wants to get authenticated, he must call for an auth_id with a challenge generated by the server
- Using the challenge, secret and initial global params, client computes a proof
- Server verifies the proof and shares a `session_id` if.
